Whether or not the agent need to carry both NHI and human identity depends on what we do with the double identity. Usually it is for access control and telemetry purposes. Consider access control first, personally I think there are 2 possibilities:\n\n1. whatever the authorization model used in the enterprise itself applies -- Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), Adaptive Access Control (AdBAC), Capability based Access Control... This leaves 2 cases:\n    1. The agent carry the identity and inherit access rights from its owner (a human or a department). Carring such human identity will help security control points make decisions with sufficient context, and to the discretion of its internal security policy.\n    2. The agent does not carry the identity from its owner. It carries independent security contexts rich enough for access control.\n\n2. We missed something important that requires a new authorization model completely. \n\nI added them in the Access Control Section as discussion placeholder. ",
